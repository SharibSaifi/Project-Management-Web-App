# Challanges Faced ---

1) Faced challenges in app.html to make the Filter select function and toggle task completion function functional.
2) Faced challenges in integrating Backend and Frontend
3) Final Challenge I faced in validation.js to validate the user for registration and login.

# Final outcome ---

1) I made successfully all the things that I have mentioned except the register and login functionality.
2) I am facing problems in integrating and validating login.html and registration.html with the Backend.

# Practical Usage --- 

The backend is working Fine but Frontend is not completed yet. So, from the backend

1) User can create projects and tasks
2) User can mark projects and tasks completed or pending.
3) User will be able to commit some changes in created project and task and delete some projects and tasks.
